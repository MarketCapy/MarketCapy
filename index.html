    <p>Short sentence to describe the image</p>
    </div>
    <p>MEMECOIN was born of several things. The first is the void left by Dogecoin. Dogecoin was basically just a satirical cryptocurrency, full of derision and lightheartedness. Community spirit, memes, laughter and fun were at the heart of the project. Since then, due to its huge success, speculators and influencers have joined the movement, and discussions now almost only revolve around its dollar value. We, who have known the crypto later, have missed the good times! Kudos to some Reddit members who remain as hilarious as ever! Ok, but there are other meme currencies created since then, you may ask? The vast majority of them are just in a marketcap race, created to get rich quick at the expense of many people. Their main objective is to find new "investors" so that the price can be increased, and the first buyers can "change their lives", "be financially free", at the expense of everyone else. They don't deserve to be called "meme" currencies.</p>
    <p>MEMECOIN was born out of frustration. We want to relive the early days of Dogecoin! We want to make crypto fun again. MEMECOIN has no marketcap objectives, and no strategy to increase the price of the token: no burn, no buy back, no active marketing, no incentive to buy. Those who buy MEMECOIN are not seen as investors, but as fun people who want to be part of a decadent adventure, and want to support a simple and refreshing initiative in this boring world <s>of hustlers</s>. To begin with, MEMECOIN will have no use other than to reward meme competitions. Eventually, maybe some great <span style="font-family: Consolas, &#39;Andale Mono&#39;, &#39;Lucida Console&#39;, &#39;Lucida Sans Typewriter&#39;, Monaco, &#39;Courier New&#39;, &#39;monospace&#39;">MEMECOINERS</span> will have ideas, and want to develop new tools or products to make MEMECOIN more useful to people, and more fun. Welcome to a long adventure.</p>
